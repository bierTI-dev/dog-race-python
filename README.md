Two dogs, Bob and Rex spotted a cat and decided to catch it
For that, they decided to bet on luck, with a die to see who would reach the cat first.
We have a straight line with two dogs, Bob and Rex, at the end of this line is Oli the cat.
This row has 10 brick blocks, Bob and Rex start at block 1 and Oli is at block 20
The "dice" you are going to throw has the geometric shape of a Decagon and therefore has 10 sides\n

## Rules:
1. Bob and Rex roll the dice together the first time, if the same position lands, they must roll again;
2. Whoever has the highest position rolls the dice first next time;
3. If they arrive together, this will start a fight between them and Oli will run away;
4. If at any time the two land on the same block, the one that took the highest number in the first round will play;
5. They advance together, so they can arrive together depending on the position they are in.
Example: If Rex is in position 19 and Bob is in position 11, rex takes 1 and Bob 9 so they arrive together in the same round in Oli's position (position 20).
